# A partial microserviced pet store implementation

Requires postgres installed and running, start multiple sbt processes and
select the appropriate service main class. Visit localhost:53251/docs to
try out the swagger ui once you have the other services started.

This app was built to demo to coworkers how tapir could simplify microservice
interactions and documentation at the same time.

It was also an excuse to experiment with libraries like quill and refined.
